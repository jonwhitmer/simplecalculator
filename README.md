# Simple Calculator

This project is a simple calculator implemented in Python. It can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and exponentiation.

## Features

- Interactive command-line interface.
- Supports operations: addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), modulus (`%`), and exponentiation (`^`).
- Allows continuous operations with the last calculated value.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have Python installed on your system. The calculator is compatible with Python 3.

## Getting Started

To run the calculator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-calculator.git
```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

```bash
cd simple-calculator
```

3. Run the script with Python:

```bash
python test.py
```

## Usage

When you run the calculator, it will prompt you to enter the first operand, an operator, and the second operand. After pressing Enter, it will display the result and offer options to perform additional calculations, clear the calculator, or turn off the calculator.
